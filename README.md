# Troubled Rowers

Troubled Rowers is a Jump 'n' Run video game that I have mainly developed in the beginning of my university time.
The game is written with the cross-platform Java game development framework [libGDX](https://libgdx.com)
and can be compiled for Android, iOS and Desktop operating systems.

Frameworks that are used in Troubled Rowers:
- Box2D (built-in): 2D physics library.
- [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley):  A tiny entity framework.
- [gdxAI](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai): An artificial intelligence framework.

## Demo
The following video shows the game in action.
The goal of the game is to steer a kanu through a stony river
while trying to not crash with the oncoming obstacles.
